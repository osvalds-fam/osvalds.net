⛷️ 🏂 ⛵️ 🏠 💒 🎓 👼🏻 🌲 🎁

While the end of the eras tour (and many current events) have been hard to stomach this year, we’re grateful to be looking back on an incredible 2024.

The year started off with finding out that we’d be welcoming a baby this fall and Zenta Paige Osvalds came into the world on October 20. It’s been a gift to see her grow and to watch the wonder of the world through her eyes, we can’t wait for this adventure of parenthood to unfold! 

As the first grandchild and niece on both sides of the family, we already know she’ll be extra spoiled this Christmas time!

While it wasn’t the best year for snow on the East Coast, we had a big year on the slopes nonetheless. We were lucky to have the Ikon pass last season and to ski over 20 days each, which after spending 5 years in the UK was incredibly nice! 

We primarily skied at Mont Tremblant in the Laurentians, North of Montreal, and also visited mountains in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Connecting with friends from near and far on the mountain will always be one of our favourite ways to spend the winter! Our ski days will look a little bit different this year, but we’re excited to spend more time on the snow in 2025.

And as if getting married and pregnant all in the same year wasn’t enough, we decided to add home ownership to the list, too. In July we took possession of our new condo in Lachine - an area on the west side of Montreal. It’s a great place for being outside with lots of paths and parks and we’re just a short, 20-minute bike ride to sailing which will be really great for many years to come. 

Finally, no year is complete without a bit of travel! 2024 was filled with celebrating some of our closest friends falling in love and getting married! From here at home in Montreal to the Okanagan, Rhode Island, Virginia and Connecticut, we were so happy to share such exciting moments in our friends’ lives.

Another travel highlight was our trip to Vancouver in May for Heather’s brother Jason’s graduation from the University of British Columbia. On top of celebrating such an amazing accomplishment for Jason, it was a great to spend the week sightseeing and spending time with Heather’s family. They did a great job to turn Niki into an Edmonton Oilers fan, too just as they started their run in the Stanley Cup finals, here’s to many years of being constantly disappointed for him.

2024 was filled with some major milestones for us and we were happy to celebrate each one with you all either in person or from afar. Thank you for being part of such an incredible year, we can’t wait to see what 2025 has in store for everyone. 

Wishing you all a very happy holiday season and a happy and healthy 2025! 

All our love, 
Niki, Heather & Zenta
