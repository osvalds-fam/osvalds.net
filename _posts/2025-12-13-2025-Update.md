Hello friends and family! 

We hope you’re all enjoying the festive season and are looking back on a wonderful year. It’s safe to say that 2025 was one of the best years yet in the Myatt/Osvalds household! 

The highlight would certainly be watching Zenta take in the world. From being just a little potato at the start of the year to running up and down the hallway with her endless babbling now, she is a joy to have in our lives, and we feel so lucky to be her parents.

Our ski days looked a little different this year, with Zenta and her little friends taking the role of Chalet Babies very seriously. While we got out a lot less this year, we were still happy to be on the mountain sharing chairlifts with friends, and we can’t wait to get Zenta out on the bunny hill in 2026.

Heather was on maternity leave for most of the year, and Niki was able to take quite a bit of paternity leave as well, which meant lots of fun family adventures! 

We escaped the Montreal mud season in April to spend most of the month in Virginia visiting Niki’s family, with a week with friends in Turks and Caicos in the middle. This move south in April is perhaps a tradition we need to continue because, wow, was it nice to thaw out, see some flowers and come back to Montreal once everything was green again!

Right before Heather went back to work at the end of August, we took one last trip to Virginia to celebrate the end of maternity leave and the start of our 2-working-parent life. It goes without saying that we feel so lucky to have had as much time off in Zenta’s first year as we did, and it’s a time we’re going to treasure forever.

The fall has felt like it’s just flown by! We’ve been settling into a good routine with daycare but could do without all the sickness thank you very much…!

We celebrated the weddings of some of our closest friends in Montreal. We LOVE a good wedding and will always be so honoured to get to celebrate our friends finding love. And of course, we celebrated Zenta’s first birthday in October! It was a wonderful afternoon to spend with our families and the friends who have helped us through our first year as parents!

While these Christmas messages are always a highlight reel and 2025 was truly a knockout year for us - it wasn’t without its hardships as well. In February, we lost Heather’s beloved Nanny. She lived an amazing 94 years and was an incredible influence in Heather’s life. She will be dearly missed by all who knew her. And as we and some very dear friends have navigated loss this year, we’re reminded of how important friends and family are - to celebrate the good times and to lean on through the darker times, too.

As December rolls in, we’re so grateful for a wonderful year, our health, our bright girl and all of you, our friends and family who make this life so special. We’re wishing you all the brightest holiday season and a happy and healthy 2026! 

All our love, 
Heather, Niki, and Zenta
